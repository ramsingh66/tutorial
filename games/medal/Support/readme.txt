2. Installation
---------------
NOTE: Medal of Honor will only install and run on machines installed with Windows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7.

To install from the Medal of Honor DVD:
1. Start your machine and wait for the Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7 operating system to load.

2. Place the Medal of Honor DVD in the DVD drive.

3. Windows will automatically detect the DVD and launch the autorun options, from which the user can select to begin the installation. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Medal of Honor. If needed, DirectX 9.0c will be installed or upgraded during the game installation.

4. The installer will prompt for the CD Key which is provided either in your confirmation email, your game manual/packaging, or game card.

5. It is optional to install Punkbuster. For online play we strongly recommend installing Punkbuster since it’s required in order to join Punkbuster enabled servers. Only Punkbuster enabled servers will report your stats, so in order to progress in ranks, receive unlocks and gain stats you will need to have Punkbuster running and play on Punkbuster enabled servers.

6. The installer will prompt how you want to authenticate your copy of Medal of Honor. Disc authentication requires the Medal of Honor disc in the drive to be able to play. Online authentication requires an internet connection but doesn’t require the Medal of Honor disc in the drive to be able to play.

Note: With online authentication you get an unlimited number of activations. Activation happens automatically the first time you run the game on a new machine. Once a machine has been activated you can play without an online connection. You are allowed to activate the game on up to 5 new machines in any given 60 day time period. When you go to activate on a new machine, you can do so on that machine as long as you have activated on less than 5 new machines in the last 60 days. Effectively, for every activation on a new machine, 60 days later your number of available activations will increase by 1. Previous activations are never lost. At any time, including if you have currently run up against your limit, you can deactivate a currently activated machine to reclaim that activation for use on a different machine.


7. For XP users, the installation program adds the program group Electronic Arts/Medal of Honor to your Start/Programs menu, and a shortcut to your desktop (optional). Click on this shortcut or alternatively click on the start button on your Windows task bar. Under Programs/Electronic Arts/Medal of Honor select "Medal of Honor" to play. For Vista/Win 7 users, the title will be added to the Games Explorer. From the Start menu, go to All Programs/Games and run Games Explorer.

Note: If the Auto insert notification feature has been disabled or the DVD is not recognized, run AutoRun.exe from the root directory of the DVD to begin the installation program.


For Medal of Honor Digital Download installation:
Please contact the digital retailer through whom you purchased this game for instructions on how to install the game or how to download and reinstall another copy of the game.

NOTE: It is optional to install Punkbuster. For online play we strongly recommend installing Punkbuster since it’s required in order to join Punkbuster enabled servers. Only Punkbuster enabled servers will report your stats, so in order to progress in ranks, receive unlocks and gain stats you will need to have Punkbuster running and play on Punkbuster enabled servers.

Computer hardware manufacturers are constantly updating their driver software so that their hardware can play the latest software programs with the best possible performance. If your system is not using the latest drivers please consider obtaining an updated driver. Doing this may also give you benefits such as increased performance, the elimination of a technical problem and new component features.

It is not recommended to use Alt+Tab or Alt+Enter commands in-game, as game functionality may be interrupted.

If the game audio sounds unbalanced, please ensure that any audio enhancements available to your sound card are disabled.

You can change what DirectX version the game will use in the settings.ini. Default value is DxVersion=auto you can change it to either 9, 10 or 11 (DirectX 10 and DirectX 11 are only supported in the multiplayer portion of Medal of Honor) . The auto setting chooses the highest DX version possible on your system. The settings.ini file is located in your documents folder in a sub folder \EA Games\Medal of Honor\Multiplayer. You can access it by opening an Explorer window and clicking on My Documents (XP) or Documents (Vista/Win 7). Open the Medal of Honor\Multiplayer folder and edit the settings.ini file. Please note that the setting.ini file will be created the first time you run Medal of Honor.
